# Movie App

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Certainly! Below is a sample `README.md` for your Movie Management App. This document provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, usage, and other relevant details.

- **Search Feature**: Filter movies by title.
- **Rating Filter**: Filter movies based on their rating using a star rating interface.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be user-friendly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Ant Design**: A design system and component library for React.
- **CSS**: Styling for layout and design.
